# 🛡️ Talent Navigator: Cracking the Code on Employee Attrition

🚶‍♂️💼 📉 🛑 🤝

## 📌 Problem Statement
Our organization has been facing a worrying trend: skilled employees are leaving faster than we can replace them. This **revolving door** isn't just a numbers problem it’s hurting team morale, slowing down projects, and costing the company a lot in recruitment and training. 

Leadership knew people were leaving, but they didn't know *exactly* why. Was it the pay? The long hours? Or maybe the frequent travel? This project was built to stop the guesswork and find the real story behind why people walk out the door.

## 📊 Data Overview
The analysis is based on a dataset of **1,470 employees** across various departments. It includes 35 different data points for every person, such as:
* **Personal Details:** Age, Gender, and Marital Status.
* **Work Life:** Department, Job Role, Overtime, and Business Travel frequency.
* **Financials:** Monthly Income and Salary Hikes.
* **History:** Years at the company and years in their current role.

By looking at these details, I was able to spot patterns that aren't visible in a simple spreadsheet.

## 🔍 Key Insights
After digging into the data, these were the most important "Aha!" moments:

* ⦿ **The Youth Flight:** Younger staff (under 25) in Sales are leaving at a staggering rate of **75%**. We are losing our future talent before they even get settled.
* ⦿ **Travel Fatigue:** Frequent business travel is a major dealbreaker. In many high-attrition groups, nearly **7 out of 10** people who left were required to travel often.
* ⦿ **The First-Year Wall:** Most people who leave do so within their first **1.3 years**. If an employee makes it past the 2-year mark, they are much more likely to stay long-term.
* ⦿ **The Pay Gap:** There is a clear "pay floor." Employees who left generally earned significantly less (Avg. **$4.1k**) than those who chose to stay (Avg. **$6.6k**).

## 💡 HR Recommendations
Based on the data, here is how we can fix the leak:

* ⦿ **Mentorship for Sales:** Create a support system for junior Sales staff under 25 to help them manage high-pressure targets.
* ⦿ **Revisit Travel:** For roles requiring "Frequent Travel," we should look at remote options or "travel-sharing" to prevent burnout.
* ⦿ **The "Year One" Focus:** Implement a stronger onboarding and check-in process during the first 12 months to help new hires feel valued early on.
* ⦿ **Fair Pay Reviews:** Conduct a salary benchmark for low-income brackets to ensure our pay is competitive enough to keep high performers.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
* **SQL:** Used for the heavy lifting—cleaning the raw data and performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to find initial correlations.
* **Power BI:** Used for building the interactive dashboard and visualizing trends.
* **Excel:** Used for quick data sorting and double-checking the final numbers.

## 🖥️ Dashboard Overview
The dashboard is designed for quick decision-making. It includes:
* **Top-Level KPIs:** Instant view of total employees, attrition count, and average age/income.
* **Interactive Slicers:** Filter the entire report by **Department**, **Age Group**, or **Income Level**.
* **Trend Charts:** Visual breakdowns showing how tenure and travel impact the decision to leave.
* **High-Risk Indicators:** Color-coded charts that highlight "red flag" groups for immediate attention.
