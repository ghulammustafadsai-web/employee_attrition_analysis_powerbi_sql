## 1. Project Background
This project was created to understand *why employees are leaving the organization* and how HR can proactively respond.

Leadership suspected issues like heavy workload, compensation gaps, and limited growth — but lacked data clarity. The objective was to replace guesswork with insights and identify which employee segments are most at risk.

Using historical HR records, this project builds an **attrition monitoring system** that highlights resignation drivers, predicts risk groups, and supports smarter retention strategies.

---

## 2. Data Set Overview
The dataset contains employee demographics, compensation, work conditions, performance trends, and employment history.

Every record represents a single employee and connects day-to-day work experiences with attrition outcomes.

This analysis answers questions such as:

- Which departments experience the most turnover?  
- Do salary differences influence resignations?  
- Are younger employees leaving faster?  
- Does frequent travel increase burnout?  
- How important is the first year of employment?

## 3. Executive Summary
The analysis shows that most employees are engaged — but several high-risk groups exist.

Attrition is strongly influenced by **age, compensation levels, travel demands, and early-career experience**. Employees under 25 and those earning below average are significantly more likely to resign. Frequent travelers and those in their first year also show elevated risk.

By tracking compensation fairness, workload pressure, and onboarding success, HR can identify critical issues early and protect valuable talent.
